# Autobase Console

**Autobase** is a comprehensive solution for managing the lifecycle of PostgreSQL clusters. The project consists of two main parts:

- **Console** — a web application (UI, API, DB) for cluster management, monitoring, and operations.
- **Automation** — an automation system based on Ansible (playbooks and roles) for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining PostgreSQL clusters.

Console and Automation are tightly integrated: users interact via the UI, which sends commands to the API. The API, when necessary, triggers Ansible playbooks to automate cluster operations.

## Console Stack

The Console stack consists of the following core components:

- **Console UI**: A web interface for managing clusters, launching operations, and monitoring status.
- **Console API**: A REST API that receives requests from the UI, interacts with the database, and triggers the automation module.
- **Console DB**: PostgreSQL database - stores information about clusters, servers, settings, and operation results.

                                       |   Console   |
                                       |      DB     |
                                       +-------------+
```

- The user interacts with the UI, which sends requests to the API.
- The API communicates with the database and, when required, launches the Automation conteiner.
- Automation uses inventory and variables generated by the Console (UI/API) to perform operations on target PostgreSQL clusters.
- Operation results and cluster status are displayed in the UI.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `console` directory:
    ```sh
    cd autobase/console
    ```

3. Setup environment:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. Configure your `.env`:
    ```sh
    DOMAIN=your-domain.com  # Set your domain
    EMAIL=your@email.com    # Required for Caddy SSL
    AUTH_TOKEN=your-token   # Your authorization token
    ```

5. Run Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```

## Notes

- Caddy will automatically handle SSL certificates for your domain
- Data is persisted in Docker volumes: `console_postgres` and `caddy_data`
- The Caddy network is created automatically by Docker Compose
- All services are configured to restart automatically unless stopped manually.
- Additional [environment variables](https://github.com/vitabaks/autobase/tree/master/console/service#configuration) can be configured based on your project needs
- Using the `latest` versions is great for testing. For production installations, specify release versions in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.
