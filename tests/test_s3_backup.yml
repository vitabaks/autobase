# Test scenarios
test_scenarios:
  - name: "Basic Backup"
    description: "Test that a basic backup can be created and uploaded to S3"
    steps:
      - "Check if S3 bucket exists"
      - "Create a full base backup"
      - "Upload the backup to S3"
      - "Verify the backup exists in S3"
  
  - name: "WAL Archiving"
    description: "Test that WAL segments are correctly archived to S3"
    steps:
      - "Force WAL switch"
      - "Verify WAL segments are uploaded to S3"
      - "Test WAL segment retrieval"
  
  - name: "Point-in-Time Recovery"
    description: "Test point-in-time recovery from S3 backups"
    steps:
      - "Create a test table and insert data"
      - "Record current timestamp"
      - "Wait for WAL to be archived"
      - "Insert more data"
      - "Restore to the recorded timestamp"
      - "Verify the first data exists but not the second"
  
  - name: "Backup Retention"
    description: "Test that old backups are deleted according to retention policy"
    steps:
      - "Create multiple backups with different timestamps"
      - "Run retention cleanup process"
      - "Verify only the expected number of backups remain"

# Test validation
validation:
  - "S3 bucket is accessible"
  - "Base backups are successfully created and uploaded to S3"
  - "WAL segments are successfully archived to S3"
  - "Point-in-time recovery works correctly"
  - "Backup retention policy is correctly enforced"
