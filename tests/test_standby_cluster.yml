    description: "Test that the standby cluster properly replicates from the primary"
    steps:
      - "Create a table on the primary"
      - "Insert data into the table"
      - "Verify the data is replicated to the standby"
  
  - name: "S3 Backup and Restore"
    description: "Test S3 backup and restore functionality"
    steps:
      - "Trigger a backup to S3"
      - "Verify the backup exists in S3"
      - "Restore from the backup to a new cluster"
      - "Verify the restored data"
  
  - name: "Failover Testing"
    description: "Test failover from primary to standby"
    steps:
      - "Manually stop the primary cluster"
      - "Promote the standby cluster to primary"
      - "Verify the standby can accept writes"
      - "Reconnect the original primary as a standby"

# Test validation
validation:
  - "All standby nodes are in sync with the primary"
  - "WAL archiving to S3 is working properly"
  - "Base backups to S3 are working properly"
  - "Failover and failback operations work correctly"
