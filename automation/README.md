# Autobase: Automation

**Autobase for PostgreSQLÂ®** automates the deployment and management of highly available PostgreSQL clusters in production environments. This solution is tailored for use on dedicated physical servers, virtual machines, and within both on-premises and cloud-based infrastructures.

For a detailed description of the cluster components, visit the [Architecture](https://autobase.tech/docs/overview/architecture) page.

## Getting Started

1. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) on one control node (which could easily be a laptop)

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip sshpass git
pip3 install ansible
```

2. Install the Autobase Collection

```sh
# from Ansible Galaxy
ansible-galaxy collection install vitabaks.autobase
```

Or reference it in a `requirements.yml`:

```yml
# from Ansible Galaxy
collections:
  - name: vitabaks.autobase
    version: 2.2.0
```

1. Prepare inventory

See example of [inventory](./inventory.example) file.

Specify (non-public) IP addresses and connection settings (`ansible_user`, `ansible_ssh_pass` or `ansible_ssh_private_key_file` for your environment

4. Prepare variables

See the [main.yml](./roles/common/defaults/main.yml) variable files for more details.

5. Test host connectivity

```sh
ansible all -m ping
```

6. Create playbook to execute the playbooks within the collection:

```yaml
- name: Playbook
  hosts: <node group name>

  tasks:
    # Start with the 'deploy' playbook, change to 'config' afterwards
    - name: Run playbook
      ansible.builtin.include_playbook: vitabaks.autobase.deploy_pgcluster
```

#### How to start from scratch

If you need to start from the very beginning, you can use the `remove_cluster` playbook.

Available variables:

- `remove_postgres`: stop the PostgreSQL service and remove data.
- `remove_etcd`: stop the ETCD service and remove data.
- `remove_consul`: stop the Consul service and remove data.

:warning: **Caution:** be careful when running this command in a production environment.
