## PostgreSQL major upgrade

This role is designed for in-place or blue-green upgrade methods (e.g., from version 17 to 18).

**Playbooks**

In-place method:
- `pg_upgrade` - Upgrades the PostgreSQL to a new major version.
- `pg_upgrade_rollback` - Performs a rollback of a PostgreSQL upgrade.

Blue-green method:
- `pg_logical_upgrade` - Upgrades the target cluster and converting a physical replica into a logical replica.
- `pg_logical_switchover` - Redirects PostgreSQL traffic from the source cluster to the target cluster with near-zero downtime.
- `pg_logical_switchover_rollback` - Switches PostgreSQL traffic back to the source cluster.
- `pg_logical_replication_stop` - Clean up publications, subscriptions, and replication slots.

#### How it works

`In-place` method upgrades the current production cluster directly. It is simpler and does not require additional servers, but it usually requires a short maintenance window (typically about 1 minute, depending on workload and environment).

`Blue-green` method upgrades a separate target cluster that is a copy of the current one, so upgrade stages on target do not impact production availability. This method is suitable when downtime must be limited to a few seconds: during switchover, the source cluster is briefly set to read-only, traffic is redirected to target (by updating PgBouncer pool backend IPs), and you can observe stability before switching the application to the address of the new cluster or rolling back to the source cluster if needed. 

Rollback is possible without losing changes made after cutover, because reverse logical replication (source <- target) is created during traffic switching.

**Database Downtime Considerations**

`In-place` To minimize the downtime, we pause PgBouncer pools. This doesn’t terminate application connections, but may temporarily increase query latency while pools are paused. The pause typically lasts ~30-60 seconds, but may be longer for large databases due to pg_upgrade and rsync. The default maximum wait time during a pause is 2 minutes (controlled by the query_wait_timeout parameter).

`Blue-green` A short service impact occurs only during switchover: the source cluster is briefly set to read-only, the remaining logical replication lag is drained, and traffic is redirected to target. Only the write traffic degrades (~10-15 seconds), while the read traffic has near-zero downtime.

## Compatibility

The upgrade is supported starting from PostgreSQL 9.3 for in-place upgrade method, and starting from PostgreSQL 12 for blue-green upgrade method.

## Requirements

Specify the current (old) version of PostgreSQL in the `pg_old_version` variable and target version of PostgreSQL for the upgrade in the `pg_new_version` variable.

For the blue-green method, deploy the target cluster in standby cluster mode. Ensure that the target cluster has the same number of PostgreSQL servers as the source cluster. This is important during switchover when configuring PgBouncer to redirect traffic to the target cluster (if PgBouncer is installed).

## Recommendations

1. Before upgrading to a new major version, it's recommended to update PostgreSQL and its extensions. Additionally, consider updating Patroni and the entire system.

   To achieve this, use the `update_pgcluster.yml` playbook. More details can be found [here](../update/README.md).

2. Before moving forward, execute preliminary checks to ensure that your database schema is compatible with the upcoming PostgreSQL version and that the cluster is ready for the upgrade.

   To do this, run the playbook using the tags '`pre-checks,upgrade-check`'.

   If any errors arise, such as schema object incompatibilities, resolve these issues and repeat the checks.

   Once the playbook completes the pre-checks without any errors, you should see the following messages in the Ansible log:
   - "`The database schema is compatible with PostgreSQL <new_version>`"
   - "`Clusters are compatible`"

   Upon seeing these messages, proceed to run the playbook without any tags to initiate the upgrade.

## Upgrade

### In-place upgrade method

Use `pg_upgrade` playbook, example:

```bash
ansible-playbook pg_upgrade.yml -i inventory -e "pg_old_version=17 pg_new_version=18"
```

**Rollback**

It's designed to be used when a PostgreSQL upgrade hasn't been fully completed and the new version hasn't been started.

```bash
ansible-playbook pg_upgrade_rollback.yml -i inventory
```

In some scenarios, if errors occur, the pg_upgrade.yml playbook may automatically initiate a rollback. Alternatively, if the automatic rollback does not occur, you can manually execute the pg_upgrade_rollback playbook to revert the changes.

The rollback operation is performed by starting the Patroni cluster with the old version of PostgreSQL using the same PGDATA. The playbook first checks the health of the current cluster, verifies the version of PostgreSQL, and ensures the new PostgreSQL is not running. If these checks pass, the playbook switches back to the old PostgreSQL paths and restarts the Patroni service.

### Blue-green upgrade method

Use `pg_logical_upgrade` playbook, example:

##### 1. Deploy the target (standby cluster)

TIP: During target cluster deployment, it is enough to point the standby cluster to the source cluster by setting either `source_cluster_host` to an IP address of the source cluster host.

Create `inventory.yml` file: describe the nodes of the current and target cluster.

```yaml
---
all:
  vars:
    # upgrade settings
    pg_old_version: 17 # the current (old) version of PostgreSQL
    pg_new_version: 18 # the target (new) version of PostgreSQL for the upgrade
    pg_replication_database: "all" # dbname for replication, 'all' for the entire cluster
    pg_publication_count: 1 # number of publications, replication slots and subscriptions
    # connection settings
    ansible_ssh_user: root
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa
  children:
    source_cluster:
      hosts:
        10.142.0.21:
        10.142.0.22:
        10.142.0.23:
    target_cluster:
      hosts:
        10.142.0.24:
        10.142.0.26:
        10.142.0.43:
```

##### 2. Upgrade the target cluster:

```bash
ansible-playbook pg_logical_upgrade.yml -i inventory.yml
```

##### 3. Switchover to the target cluster:

After pg_logical_upgrade is completed and logical replication is active (source -> target), use `pg_logical_switchover` playbook to switch production traffic to the target cluster.

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/pg_logical_switchover.yml -i inventory.yml
```

WARNING: If PgBouncer is not installed in your cluster, traffic redirection will not happen automatically.
In this case, use the following sequence:
   1. Stop your application
   2. Run the pg_logical_switchover playbook
   3. Start your application and point it to the new (target) cluster address

Optionally:

- **Force mode** (allow a small lag during cutover):

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbooks/pg_logical_switchover.yml -i inventory.yml \
      -e "pg_switchover_force_mode=true pg_switchover_force_mode_lag_bytes=1048576"
    ```

- **Rollback** after switchover (if you need to move traffic back to the original cluster):

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook playbooks/pg_logical_switchover_rollback.yml -i inventory.yml
    ```

##### 4. Switch application to the target cluster

After observing your services and database on the new cluster, if everything is stable, switch your application to the new cluster by updating the connection string with the new cluster address.

##### 5. Stop reverse replication

To clean up logical replication objects after migration (subscriptions, replication slots, and publications), run:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/pg_logical_replication_stop.yml -i inventory.yml
```

### Upgrade Plan:

#### PRE-UPGRADE: Perform Pre-Checks

- **Make sure that the required variables are specified**
  - Notes: `pg_old_version` and `pg_new_version` variables
  - Stop, if one or more required variables have empty values.
- **Make sure that the old and new data and config directories do not match**
  - Stop, if `pg_old_datadir` and `pg_new_datadir`, or `pg_old_confdir` and `pg_new_confdir` match.
