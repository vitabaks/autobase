# This playbook performs a rollback of a PostgreSQL upgrade.
# It's designed to be used when a PostgreSQL upgrade hasn't been fully completed and the new version hasn't been started.
# The rollback operation is performed by starting the Patroni cluster with the old version of PostgreSQL using the same PGDATA.
# The playbook first checks the health of the current cluster, verifies the version of PostgreSQL, and ensures the new PostgreSQL is not running.
# If these checks pass, the playbook switches back to the old PostgreSQL paths and restarts the Patroni service.
